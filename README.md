# Constrained Attention Filter (CAF)
(ECCV 2020) Tensorflow implementation of **A Generic Visualization Approach for Convolutional Neural Networks**

Will upload code after finalizing the camera ready version.

### Teaser

### TL;DR
The code components of L2-CAF are
1- TF filter
2- Optimization loop
3- Finalize filter before saving

## Requirements

* Python 3+ [Tested on 3.7]
* Tensorflow 1.X [Tested on 1.14]

## ImageNet Pretrained Models
I used the following
* [DenseNet model](https://github.com/pudae/tensorflow-densenet)
* InceptionV1
* ResNet



## Release History
* 1.0.0
    * First commit Vanilla L2-CAF on DenseNet 12 July 2020
    
### TODO LIST
* Add Fast L2-CAF
* Add InceptionNet and ResNet support
* Document to use the code


## Contributing
**It would be great if someone re-implement this in pytorch. Let me know and I will add a link to your Pytorch implementation here**
